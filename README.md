### Getting Yeasty ###

To start baking a new yeasty project:

    cd /path/to/my/projects
    git clone git://github.com/gcnovus/yeast.git --origin yeast my_project
    cd my_project
    git remote add origin git://git.repository.for/my_project.git
    
where `my_project` is the name of the new yeasty project you're starting.

If you want to pull in changes from Yeast itself later,
use `git pull yeast master`. Caveat confundator proelia! (That is,
"may the one who merges beware of conflicts!")
